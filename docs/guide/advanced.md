# Advanced Goction Usage

This guide covers advanced features and usage scenarios for Goction, aimed at users who are already familiar with the basics.

## Custom Goction Development

### Using External Packages

1. Initialize a Go module in your goction directory:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/goction/goctions/my_goction
   go mod init my_goction
   ```

2. Add dependencies:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/example/package
   ```

3. Use the package in your `main.go`:
   ```go
   import "github.com/example/package"
   ```

4. Update your goction:
   ```bash
   goction update my_goction
   ```

### Best Practices for Goction Development

- Keep goctions focused on a single task
- Use meaningful names for your goctions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Write unit tests for your goctions

## Advanced API Usage

### Batch Execution

Execute multiple goctions in a single API call:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Token: your-secret-token" \
  -d '{
    "goctions": [
      {"name": "goction1", "args": ["arg1", "arg2"]},
      {"name": "goction2", "args": ["arg3"]}
    ]
  }' \
  http://localhost:8080/api/batch
```

### Webhooks

Configure webhooks to trigger goctions on external events:

1. Set up a webhook in the Goction configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "webhooks": {
       "my_webhook": {
         "goction": "my_goction",
         "secret": "webhook_secret"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. Trigger the webhook:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     -H "X-Webhook-Secret: webhook_secret" \
     -d '{"data": "example"}' \
     http://localhost:8080/api/webhooks/my_webhook
   ```

## Performance Tuning

### Optimizing Goction Execution

- Use goroutines for concurrent operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Profile your goctions to identify bottlenecks

### Scaling Goction

For high-load scenarios, consider:

- Using a load balancer
- Implementing a distributed goction execution system
- Optimizing your database queries

## Advanced Monitoring and Logging

### Integrating with External Monitoring Systems

Goction can be integrated with various monitoring systems:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- ELK stack for log analysis
- Grafana for visualization

### Custom Logging

Configure advanced logging options in your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "log_level": "debug",
  "log_format": "json",
  "log_output": ["file", "stdout"],
  "log_file": "/var/log/goction/goction.log"
}
```

## Security Enhancements

- Implement IP whitelisting for API access
- Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for API authentication
- Encrypt sensitive data in goctions using Goction's built-in encryption helpers

## Extending Goction

### Creating Plugins

Develop plugins to extend Goction's functionality:

1. Create a new Go package implementing the Goction plugin interface
2. Build your plugin as a shared object (.so file)
3. Place the .so file in the Goction plugins directory
4. Update the Goction configuration to load your plugin

### Custom Dashboard Widgets

Develop custom widgets for the Goction dashboard:

1. Create a new React component
2. Register the component in the Goction dashboard configuration
3. Restart the Goction service to load the new widget

## Automation and CI/CD Integration

- Use Goction in your CI/CD pipelines for automated tasks
- Integrate Goction with configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet
- Develop goctions for automated deployment and rollback procedures
