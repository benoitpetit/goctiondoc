# Advanced Topics

This guide covers advanced features and usage scenarios for Goction.

## 1. Custom Goction Development

### a. Using External Packages

You can use any Go packages in your goctions. Here's how:

1. In your goction directory, initialize a Go module:

   ```bash
   go mod init mygoction
   ```

2. Add your dependencies:

   ```bash
   go get github.com/example/package
   ```

3. Use the package in your `main.go`:

   ```go
   import "github.com/example/package"
   ```

4. Update your goction:
   ```bash
   goction update mygoction
   ```

### b. Goction Best Practices

- Keep your goctions focused on a single task
- Use meaningful names for your goctions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use environment variables for sensitive information

## 2. API Authentication

Goction uses token-based authentication for its API. To generate a new token:

```bash
goction token generate
```

Use this token in the `X-API-Token` header when making API requests.

## 3. Performance Tuning

### a. Optimizing Goction Execution

- Use goroutines for concurrent operations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Profile your goctions to identify bottlenecks

### b. Scaling Goction

For high-load scenarios, consider:

- Using a load balancer
- Implementing a distributed goction execution system
- Optimizing your database queries

## 4. Monitoring and Logging

### a. Advanced Logging

Goction uses logrus for logging. You can configure advanced logging options in your `config.json`:

```json
{
  "log_level": "debug",
  "log_format": "json"
}
```

### b. Integrating with Monitoring Systems

Goction can be integrated with various monitoring systems:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- ELK stack for log analysis
- Grafana for visualization

## 5. Security Considerations

- Regularly rotate your API tokens
- Use HTTPS for API communication
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regularly update Goction and its dependencies
